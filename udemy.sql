INSERT INTO `course` VALUES (5, 'The Data Science Course 2021: Complete Data Science Bootcamp', 'Complete Data Science Training: Mathematics, Statistics, Python, Advanced Statistics in Python, Machine & Deep Learning', '<div data-purpose=\"safely-set-inner-html:description:description\">\r\n<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>\r\n<p>Data scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And how can you do that? &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming) &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Solution</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Mathematics &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Statistics &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Python &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Data Visualization &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Machine Learning &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Deep Learning &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don&rsquo;t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2021.</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field&nbsp;<strong>&ndash; having all the necessary resources in one place.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save). &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Skills</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;Intro to Data and Data Science</strong></p>\r\n<p>Big data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp;As a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This &lsquo;Intro to data and data science&rsquo; will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>2. Mathematics</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Calculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>3. Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This course doesn&rsquo;t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>4. Python</strong></p>\r\n<p>Python is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That&rsquo;s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>5. Tableau</strong></p>\r\n<p>Data scientists don&rsquo;t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data&rsquo;s story in a way they will understand. That&rsquo;s where Tableau comes in &ndash; and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>6. Advanced Statistics</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Data science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this &lsquo;advance statistics&rsquo; section. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>7. Machine Learning</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data&nbsp;<em>scientist&nbsp;</em>from a data&nbsp;<em>analyst.&nbsp;</em>This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why learn it?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Machine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years. Now is the time for&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;to control the machines. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>***What you get***</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>A $1250 data science training program &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Active Q&amp;A support &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>All the knowledge to get hired as a data scientist &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>A community of data science learners &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>A certificate of completion &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Access to future updates &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Solve real-life business cases that will get you the job&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>You will become a data scientist from scratch</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We are happy to offer an unconditional 30-day money back in full guarantee.

Angela, you\'re awesome!

Love all the extras the course provides especially the assets(graphics, sound files, etc) for practice projects as I\'m always taking too much time to find some assets to play with. This course understands how to teach programmers by giving them the toolsets and abilities they need to build apps. The course teaches the foundation of the language as well as skills to build your knowledge and improve your troubleshooting skills. Angela is a wonderful speaker and should do the voiceovers on everyone\'s instructional videos, seriously. :)\" - Marcy Vernon</em></p>\r\n<p><em>\"Def. an amazing and awesome class for learning iOS programming.

You\'ll&nbsp;<strong>learn everything by example</strong>, by analysing and exploiting different systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc. We\'ll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.</p>\r\n<p>The course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you\'ll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to&nbsp;<strong>practically</strong>&nbsp;exploit theses weaknesses to hack into this system.</p>\r\n<p>By the end of the course you will have a strong foundation in most hacking or penetration testing fields and you\'ll also learn how to&nbsp;<strong>detect, prevent and secure</strong>&nbsp;systems and yourself from&nbsp;the discussed attacks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The course is divided into four main sections:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;Network Hacking</strong><em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em>This section will teach you how to test the security of both wired &amp; wireless networks. First, you will learn network basics, how they work, and how devices communicate with each other. Then it will branch into three sub sections:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Pre-connection<strong>&nbsp;</strong>attacks:<em>&nbsp;</em>in this subsection you\'ll learn a number of attacks that can be executed without connecting to the target network and without the need to know the network password; you\'ll learn how to&nbsp;<strong>gather&nbsp;information</strong>&nbsp;about the networks around you, discover connected devices, and control connections (<strong>deny/allow devices from connecting to networks</strong>).</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Gaining Access: Now that you gathered information about&nbsp;the networks around you, in this subsection you will learn how to&nbsp;<strong>crack</strong>&nbsp;the key and get the password to your target network weather it uses<strong>&nbsp;WEP, WPA&nbsp;</strong>or even<strong>&nbsp;WPA2</strong>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Post Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can connect to the target network, in this subsection you will learn a number of<strong>&nbsp;powerful techniques</strong>&nbsp;that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices,&nbsp;<strong>see anything they do on the internet</strong>&nbsp;(such as login information,&nbsp;<strong>passwords</strong>, visited urls, images, videos ....etc), redirect requests,&nbsp;<strong>inject evil code</strong>&nbsp;in loaded pages and much more! All of these attacks work against both wireless and wired networks. You will also learn how to&nbsp;<strong>create a fake WiFi network,</strong>&nbsp;attract users to connect to it and use all of the above techniques against the connected clients.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Gaining Access</strong><em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em>In this section you will learn two main approaches to&nbsp;<strong>gain full control or hack&nbsp;computer systems</strong>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Server Side Attacks<em>: &nbsp;</em>In this subsection you will learn how to&nbsp;<strong>gain full access</strong>&nbsp;to computer systems&nbsp;<strong>without user interaction</strong>. You will learn how to gather useful information about a target computer system such as its&nbsp;operating system,&nbsp;open ports, installed services, then use this information to&nbsp;<strong>discover weaknesses and vulnerabilities</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>exploit</strong>&nbsp;them to gain full control over the target. Finally you will&nbsp;learn how to automatically scan servers for vulnerabilities and generate different types of&nbsp;<strong>reports</strong>&nbsp;with your discoveries.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Client Side Attacks<em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em>If the target system does not contain any weaknesses then the only way to hack it is by interacting with the users, in this subsection you\'ll learn how to get the target user to install a backdoor on their system without even realising, this is done by&nbsp;<strong>hijacking software updates</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>backdoornig downloadeds&nbsp;</strong>on the fly. This subsection also teaches you how to use social engineering to hack into secure systems, so you\'ll learn how to gather comprehensive information about system users such as their social accounts, friends, their mails.....etc, you\'ll learn how to&nbsp;<strong>create trojans</strong>&nbsp;by backdooring normal files (such as an image or a pdf) and use the gathered information to spoof emails so they appear as if they\'re sent from the target\'s friend, boss or any email account they\'re likely to interact with, to social engineer them into running your torjan.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Post Exploitation</strong><em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em>In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised so far. You&rsquo;ll&nbsp;learn how to<strong>&nbsp;access the file system&nbsp;</strong>(read/write/upload/execute),&nbsp;<strong>maintain your access</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>spy</strong>&nbsp;on the target (capture key strikes, turn on the webcam, take screenshots....etc) and even&nbsp;use the target computer as a&nbsp;<strong>pivot&nbsp;</strong>to hack other systems.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp;Website / Web Application Hacking</strong><em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</em>In this section you will learn&nbsp;<strong>how websites work</strong>, how to&nbsp;<strong>gather information</strong>&nbsp;about a target website (such as website owner, server location, used technologies ....etc) and how to&nbsp;<strong>discover&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;exploit&nbsp;</strong>the following dangerous&nbsp;<strong>vulnerabilities</strong>&nbsp;to hack into websites:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>File Upload.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Code Execution.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Local File Inclusion.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Remote File Inclusion.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>SQL Injection.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Cross Site Scripting (XSS).</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At the end of each section you will&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;<strong>detect, prevent and secure</strong>&nbsp;systems and yourself from&nbsp;the discussed attacks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All the techniques in this course are&nbsp;<strong>practical</strong>&nbsp;and work against real systems, you\'ll understand the whole mechanism of each technique first, then you\'ll learn how to use it to hack into the target system. By the end of the course you\'ll be able to modify the these techniques to launch more powerful attacks, and adopt them to suit different situations and different scenarios.</p>\r\n<p>With this course you\'ll get&nbsp;<strong>24/7 support</strong>, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&amp;A section and we\'ll respond to you within 15 hours.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Notes:</em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><em>This course is created for educational purposes only,&nbsp;all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against systems that I have permission to test.</em></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><em>This course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih &amp; zSecurity and no other organisation&nbsp;is associated with it or a certification exam.

I like that he takes enough time to explain each new concept or module without being repetitive or using jargon that\'s difficult to follow. I also love being able to follow along with Andy as he explains each new module as well (as opposed to just talking off of slides all the time). He literally walks you through everything, so it\'s like you\'re right there looking over his shoulder. For anyone wanting to understand all the fundamentals of Wordpress, I think you\'ll absolutely love this course. It will save you tons of time by having all this information in one place.

I\'ve always had a lot of questions about the many settings and various options in Wordpress and most courses just skip over them or tell you to check this box and move on with no explanation. I never really got my questions answered until now. Andy is very detailed in his instruction. He walks you through step by step and tells you what each setting or section is for, how it is used (or not used) and why. I got more out of Andy\'s course than any other course I\'ve ever taken.

I\'m now much more confident about starting a new affiliate marketing website.&nbsp;</em><strong>Leon</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><em>Well delivered, well structured.

This is a great course and it has helped me start to build my own WordPress website. I was very impressed when I had a problem with viewing my site that you took time to check for me. That shows what a great teacher you are. I have booked up another course by to and can\'t wait for more. Once again. Thank you.&nbsp;</em><strong>B Brown</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><em>Many of the courses I\'ve been through related to learning Wordpress are either too complicated or the author doesn\'t spend enough time explaining concepts so that you can understand what\'s being said. Andy strikes a nice balance with this course in that all the modules are broken up into easily digestible pieces. I like that he takes enough time to explain each new concept or module without being repetitive or using jargon that\'s difficult to follow. I also love being able to follow along with Andy as he explains each new module as well (as opposed to just talking off of slides all the time). He literally walks you through everything, so it\'s like you\'re right there looking over his shoulder. For anyone wanting to understand all the fundamentals of Wordpress, I think you\'ll absolutely love this course. It will save you tons of time by having all this information in one place. And you\'ll even learn some additional features like setting up affiliate links (not that everyone needs to know this but I like that Andy included it so it\'s there if you ever want to know). Truly a fantastic course!</em>&nbsp;<strong>Lance Gross</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><em>Superb Course - Extraordinary Instructor!!&nbsp;Andy\'s Wordpress for Beginners-Master Wordpress Quicky course is by far the best Wordpress course I\'ve seen. And I definitely wouldn\'t say it\'s just for beginners. I\'m not a beginner - I thought I knew Wordpress pretty well, but I learned SO MUCH MORE from this course! I\'ve always had a lot of questions about the many settings and various options in Wordpress and most courses just skip over them or tell you to check this box and move on with no explanation. I never really got my questions answered until now. Andy is very detailed in his instruction. He walks you through step by step and tells you what each setting or section is for, how it is used (or not used) and why. I got more out of Andy\'s course than any other course I\'ve ever taken. He has an extensive teaching background and it is evident in his clearly produced videos. After taking this course, you\'ll find your confidence level will soar.</em>&nbsp;<strong>Carol</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"styles--audience--2pZ0S\" data-purpose=\"target-audience\">\r\n<h2 class=\"udlite-heading-xl styles--audience__title--1Sob_\">Who this course is for:</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"styles--audience__list--3NCqY\">\r\n<li>If you want to learn Wordpress without paying for a web host, this course is perfect.
